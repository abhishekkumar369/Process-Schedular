# Process-Schedular
This project is a web-based application for visualizing and simulating various CPU scheduling algorithms. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to understand and compare different scheduling techniques like FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority Scheduling, Round Robin etc.

# Features
(a) Algorithm Selection: Choose from a variety of scheduling algorithms, including:
 (1) FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
 (2) SJF (Shortest Job First)
 (3) SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
 (4) Priority Scheduling
 (5) Round Robin (with dynamic time quantum)
 
(b) Process Creation: Easily input process details such as arrival time, burst time, and priority.
(c) Gantt Chart Visualization: Visual representation of the scheduling process, showcasing the execution order of processes over time.
(c) Time Quantum: For Round Robin scheduling, dynamically set the time quantum.
(d) Responsive Design: Ensures usability across different devices and screen sizes.
(e) Interactive UI: Intuitive interface with real-time updates and clear visual feedback.

# Technologies Used
 HTML: Structuring the content and layout of the application.
 CSS: Styling the application with a focus on a deep blue theme, ensuring a visually appealing design.
 JavaScript: Implementing the logic for scheduling algorithms and dynamic interactions.

# Usage
(1) Select Scheduling Algorithm: Use the interface to select your desired scheduling algorithm from the options provided.
(2) Create Processes: Enter the details for each process, including arrival time, burst time, and priority (if applicable).
(3) Execute: Click the "Execute" button to visualize the scheduling process and view the Gantt chart.


# Future Enhancements
Additional Algorithms: Implementing more advanced scheduling algorithms.
Detailed Statistics: Providing detailed statistics and performance metrics for each scheduling simulation.
User Authentication: Adding user accounts to save and load scheduling scenarios.
Advanced Visualization: Improving the Gantt chart with more interactive and informative features.
